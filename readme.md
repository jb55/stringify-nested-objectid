  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jb55/stringify-nested-objectid.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jb55/stringify-nested-objectid)

  toString() aka. toHexString() bson ObjectIDs nested in an object

## Rationale

Seriaizing objects using something other than toJSON (like csvs) will have
weird output if ObjectIds aren't stringified properly first

## Installation

  Install with npm

    $ npm install stringify-nested-objid

## Example

```js
var stringify = require('stringify-nested-objid')

var obj = {
  name: "Bill",
  _id: ObjectID("5435b3affbca420bda59fb4d")
}

// mutate
stringify(obj)

// pure
obj = stringify.pure(obj)

// obj is: { name: 'Bill', _id: '5435b3affbca420bda59fb4d' }
```

## API

### stringify(obj)

takes an object, returns the mutated object

### stringify.pure(obj)

takes an object, makes a clone, and returns the updated cloned object

### stringify.stream()

an object through2 stream that stringifies object ids impurely

### stringify.stream.pure()

an object through2 stream that stringifies object ids purely
